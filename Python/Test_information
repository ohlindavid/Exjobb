This file contains information about what test refers to the test files in this folder.


"TestBins2Bins.py":
This is a test on AlbinDamir data than takes binned EEG from subject 6 (labels FA and LM) and trains one network on each learning phase bin (calculates a validation score as well). Then it applies each bin-network to each decoding phase bin.
Binned train: "C:/Users/Oskar/Documents/GitHub/exjobb/AD_comp_to_Bramao/"
Binned pred/decoding: "C:/Users/Oskar/Documents/GitHub/exjobb/AD_comp_to_Bramao_Pred/"
More subjects? Try multiple subjects for the test above and 2 below to find the one with the best results.

Multiple categories

Train, validation and test on subject X from AlbinDamir data set.

Train, validation and test on binned EEG from subject X from AlbinDamir data set. validate and test on same bin as training.

"TestSim1ch5comp.py":
Simulated data with 5 components on 1 channel. Input to multigaussdata.m was (N=512,Fs=512):
A: (N,[100 100 300 512 10^7],[0.5 0.5 1 1 1],[0.7 0.1 0.4 0.5 0],[6 6 12 17 1],[0 0.05 0 0 0],Fs)
B: (N,[100 100 300 512 10^7],[0.5 0.5 1 1 1],[0.7 0.1 0.4 0.5 0],[6 6 8 17 1],[0 0.05 0 0 0],Fs)
So difference between a and b is a different alpha frequency. Make new data with generating1ch5comp.m.

"TestSim1ch5compNoise.py":
Exact same as above but with noise with SNR=1.1. Make new data with generating1ch5comp.m.

"TestChirp.py":
Simulated data with chirp signal (1ch) (N=512,Fs=512) with composition:
A: time 0 Freq 0 ----> time 1 frequency 40
B: time 0 Freq 0 ----> time 1 frequency 50

"TestChirpNoise.py"
Same as above but with SNR=1.1 noise.


Test for only first layer?

Test to measure initialization
