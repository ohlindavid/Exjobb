% 1 = Test phase, retrieval 
% NegALL1   = Subject recalls Negative Valence correctly (face & scenes)
% NegFace1  = Subject recalls Negative Face Image correctly
% NegScene1 = Subject recalls Negative Scene Image correctly
% NeuALL1   = Subject recalls Neutrality of Image correctly (face & scenes)
% NeuFace1  = Subject recalls Neutral Face Image correctly
% NeuScene1 = Subject recalls Neutral Scene Image correctly
% PosALL1   = Subject recalls Positive Valence correctly (face & scenes)
% PosFace1  = Subject recalls Positive Face Image correctly
% PosScene1 = Subject recalls Positive Scene Image correctly
% EmoALL1   = Subject recalls Emotional (pos OR neg) Image correctly ((face & scenes)
% EmoFace1  = Subject recalls Emotional Face Image correctly (so pos/neg vs neu)
% EmoScene1 = Subject recalls Emotional Scene Image correctly (so pos/neg vs neu)
% FaceALL1  = Subject recalls Face Image correctly (contains pos/neg/neu)
% SceneALL1 = Subject recalls Scene Image correctly (contains pos/neg/neu)

% At current, those trials that were not recalled correctly are not
% included, but I can make more complete files so the classification can be
% compared to incorrect/absent retrieval.
